This is the MonteModes documentation
=====================================

This is a test of the documentation for montemodes
.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
   :label: euler

Euler's identity, equation :eq:`euler`, was elected one of the most
beautiful mathematical formulas.

Install the code
------------------------------------

Download the code and use :file: `setup.py` to install the code

The you can call the script :program:`montemodes` to execute the code.
Finally,  Just run ::

   $ montemodes

and the software is executed.


Final remarks
---------------------------

Here the example ends. No more.
